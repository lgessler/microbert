<p>I request sysop access.</p>
<p>The Wolof Wikipedia does not currently have any Wolof speaking contributors. Thus far I have been unable to contact the administrator who also does not understand Wolof. Although I am new to Wikipedia, I would like to be able to set up a sub-project on the Wolof site (Bible Encylopedia in Wolof) which I would like to moderate personnally, and also develop a Wolof user interface. Thus I would like to have temporary administrator access. I live in the bush with a poor internet connection. This would be sufficient to keep an eye on new contributions, but not for major new development. Thus, most of my work will be done on monthly visits to the capital. Therefore I would appreciate at least a period of 6 months, with a view to an eventual permanent administrator status.</p>
